Salary Prediction using Linear Regression Model with Flutter and FastAPI
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a salary prediction model using a Linear Regression algorithm, Flutter for the mobile app frontend, and FastAPI for creating an API backend.

Overview
In this project, a Linear Regression model is trained to predict the salary based on features such as Education Level, Job Title, Age, and Years of Experience. The trained model is deployed using FastAPI, which serves as the backend for processing requests. The frontend is built using Flutter, which interacts with the API to display predictions.

Technologies Used
Python for backend development
FastAPI for creating the RESTful API
scikit-learn for training the Linear Regression model
pandas for data manipulation
Flutter for the mobile frontend
Dart for Flutter development
Joblib for saving the trained model
Matplotlib for visualizing results
SQLite (or another DB) for storing prediction data (optional)
Setup Instructions
Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction.git
cd salary-prediction
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the Model (if not already pre-trained):

In the model_training.py file, the Linear Regression model is trained. This file reads the dataset, trains the model, and saves the trained model using joblib.
bash
Copy code
python model_training.py
Run the FastAPI server:

Start the FastAPI server to expose the prediction API.

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will be hosted at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Frontend Setup
Install Flutter:

Download and install Flutter from the official site: Flutter Installation

Clone the Flutter repository:

If you haven't already, clone the repository that contains the Flutter project.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction-flutter.git
cd salary-prediction-flutter
Install dependencies:

Run the following command to install all required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run the app:

Make sure your device (or emulator) is ready and run:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
The Flutter app will start, and you will be able to input user data (such as education level, job title, etc.) and see the predicted salary.
Model Training and Deployment
Dataset: A synthetic dataset or real-world salary data containing information such as Education Level, Job Title, Age, Years of Experience, and Salary is used to train the Linear Regression model.

Model: A Linear Regression model is trained using scikit-learn. The model is then serialized and saved using joblib for use in the FastAPI backend.

FastAPI Backend: The backend accepts data from the Flutter app, processes it using the trained Linear Regression model, and returns a predicted salary. FastAPI provides fast asynchronous request handling and a simple structure for building APIs.

Usage
1. Making Predictions:
Once the server is running, the Flutter app will send a POST request to the FastAPI server with the user's input. The FastAPI backend will process the request, run the prediction using the pre-trained Linear Regression model, and return the predicted salary.

2. Flutter Mobile App:
The mobile app collects data such as:

Education Level
Job Title
Age
Years of Experience
After the user submits the form, the app sends the input data to the FastAPI backend, receives the predicted salary, and displays it to the user.

API Endpoints
1. POST /predict
Description: Predicts the salary based on user input.

Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "education_level": "Bachelor",
  "job_title": "Software Engineer",
  "age": 30,
  "years_of_experience": 5
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "predicted_salary": 75000.00
}
Example:

Sending the POST request to the endpoint with the necessary fields will return the predicted salary.
